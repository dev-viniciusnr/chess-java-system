# Chess Java System

This project was developed as part of my learning journey in Java programming.  
It consists of a complete terminal-based chess game, built using object-oriented programming principles such as classes, encapsulation, composition, and enums.

The goal of this project was to practice Java fundamentals by implementing game logic, move validation, and a basic command-line interface â€” all without any external libraries or frameworks.

It's a great exercise in logic, clean design, and core Java structure.
